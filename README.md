You only need to download the entire zip file and extract it to your own device, and open the project configuration environment through pycharm to apply it.

After opening, you will see these files. The relevant files are stored under the dataset. Model is some available models (you can use models written by yourself or shared by others). Utils is some py that needs to be prepared in the framework. Program (no need to modify if there are no special requirements).

We just need to change some hyperparameters in the config to train. Please allow the train file for training, train the test file for testing, and run the inference_image file for inference on an image.
